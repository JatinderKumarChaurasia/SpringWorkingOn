DAO(Data Access Object) - a common design pattern responsible for interfacing with the database.
Entity Class - Java Class that is mapped to database table
@Transactional - a annotation that auto-magically begin and end transaction for our hibernate code instead of doing like:
   session.beginTransaction() or session.getTransaction.commit(); @Transactional do that work for us.
@Repository - annotation applied for DAO Implementations - inherit from @Component
 -- spring automatically register the DAO implementations using component-scanning.
 -- it also provides translation of any JDBC related exceptions.
@Component - where spring do component scanning for java beans
